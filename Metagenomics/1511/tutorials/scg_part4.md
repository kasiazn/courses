# Part 4: Coverage plotting, chimera detection and inspection

As explained during the lectures, the genome amplification process (MDA) results in a coverage bias across the genome and induces chimera formation. 
Here you will have a look at the 'best' assembly that you managed to obtain, and try to assess the level of bias and chimera formation.
In order to visualize the coverage of a normal single-cell assembly, you need to map your reads used in the assembly, back to your assembled contigs. You can then visualize the coverage in Artemis. We will also use a tool to inspect potential chimeras and check the insert size using the pairs. 

Here are the questions that these results should help you answer:

### Questions
---

**Q4.1** What was the highest coverage for any of your contigs?  
**Q4.2** Do you think that the completeness of your SC genome will improve with more sequence data? Why? Will your genome ever be ‘complete’?  
**Q4.3** How would you explain the coverage patterns you can see on the contigs called NODE_7 and NODE_4.  
**Q4.4** How many chimeric reads did you find in your original dataset? Do you think this value is a true representation of the total amount of chimeras?  
**Q4.5** What was the average insert size in this dataset?
